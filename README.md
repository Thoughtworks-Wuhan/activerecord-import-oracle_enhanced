# activerecord-import-oracle_enhanced

activerecord-import-oracle_enhanced is an extension for activerecord-import to provide support for the activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter.

It uses Oracle multitable insert and assumes that you have a DML trigger setup for the targeting table before inserting.

## DML Trigger

Since Oracle needs to prefetch the primary key and a call to `<sequence_name>.nextval` will always return the same value in an INSERT ALL statement. Consequently, if you want to properly use this gem and bulk insert data into tables which have a primary key without providing said key, you have to create a DML trigger which fires before inserting a row into your table and setting your primary key if it is not set. Such a trigger could be written as such (replacing `<table_name>` and `<sequence_name>` with the proper values) :

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE trigger <table_name>_trg
    before insert on <table_name>
    for each row
BEGIN
    IF :new.id IS NULL THEN :new.id := <sequence_name>.nextval;
    END IF;
END;
/
```

Bear in mind that you have to respect Oracle limitations of 30 characters for the trigger name.
